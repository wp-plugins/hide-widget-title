Adds checkbox to all widgets enabling you to hide a widget title on frontend. All widget titles remain visible in admin.

== Description ==

Adds checkbox to all widgets that enables you to hide a widget title on the frontend of your site. All widget titles remain visible in admin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'hide-widget-title' folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin application

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

Once the plugin is activated you will see a new checkbox at the bottom left of each widget that says
"Hide title from public users". Checking this box will hide the title of the widget on the frontend
of your site. The widget title will still be visible on each widget in your admin area.

= Why would I need this plugin? =

I have clients who are using several dozen widgets and have the need to NOT display the widget titles.
Without this plugin they were forced to leave the widget titles blank and it became very difficult and
time consuming to find a particular widget to make a simple change to the content within a widget.

Thus, Hide Widget Title was born.
